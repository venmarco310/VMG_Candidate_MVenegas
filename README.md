# VMG_Candidate_MVenegas
To run this code, download all of thes files in to your repository. You will need to provide a directory to imgDataV2 to where you downloaded img_align_celeba folder.
This code runs similar to the matlab code, so you only have to run "main_Candidacy_MVenegas.ipynb" file. 

If you get errors for 'device = torch.device('cuda:0' if torch.cuda.is_available() else 'cpu')', change to device = torch.device('cpu'). This code appears in the 'setup.ipynb' file and "main_Candidacy_MVenegas.ipynb" file.
